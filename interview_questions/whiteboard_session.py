*** BALANCE BRACKET PROBLEM ***

Write a function that takes a string as input. 
The string can contain three types of brackets: "[]", "()", "{}". 
Your function should return a boolean indicating whether or not the string is balanced.  
A string is considered balanced if it has as many opening brackets of a given type as it has closing brackets
of that same type. 
No bracket can be left unmatched if the string is to be considered balanced. 
A closing bracket also cannot match a corresponding opening bracket that comes after it. 
Brackets also cannot overlap each other, i.e., "[(])".

# Examples:
# "[(])" should return false
# "foo(bar)baz" should return true
# "{{[]}}" should return true
# "I am happy to take your donation; any amount will be greatly appreciated." should return true
# "I (wa)n{t to buy a on}esie[â€¦] b(u{[t] kno}w it) won't suit me." should return true
# "This is t(he la[st random sentence I will be writing and I am going to stop mid-sent]" should return false


# It takes a string as an input
# Can contain three bracket types
# Should return true if the string is balanced (should
# have at least an opening and closing bracket of the same type) otherwise return false
# ][ is invalid
# [(]) (There has to a value in between each bracket)


# "[{let}]" - balanced
# "[{}]" - balanced

# If it is not a string, return False
# If we get a string, run through the string
# compare the character at the current index to the character at the next index
# if the first identifiable character at the current index is a closing bracket, it should return False

# if the character matches the key in the dictionary save to the opening bracket list
